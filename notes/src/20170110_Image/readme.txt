image.{fs,fsi} - a generic library of image operating functions
imageProcessing.fsx - examples, channels, histograms, smoothing, differential operators
imageOperatorsProblem.fsx - operator overloading overwrites all types
imageClass.fsx - operator per class is fine, so let's make a class
imageClassGeneric.fsx - generalize class to handle several types
imageClassGeneric2.fsx - add operators (pretty tedious)
imageClassGeneric3.fsx - simplify operator extension by generic functions
