Extend the implementation with a class \lstinline{Player} and two derived classes \lstinline{Human} and \lstinline{Computer}. The derived classes must have a method \lstinline{nextMove}, which returns a legal movement as a codestring or the string ``quit''.  A codestring is a string of the name of two squares separated by a space. E.g., if the white king is placed at a4, and a5 is an available move for the king, then a legal codestring for moving the king to a5 is ``a4 a5''. The player can be either a human or the computer. If the player is human, then the codestring is obtained by a text dialogue with the user. If the player is the computer, then the codestring must be constructed from a random selection of available move of one of its pieces.
