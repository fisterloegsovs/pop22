The following exercises are about expanding and using the following
recursive sumtype, which can be used for modelling arithmetic expressions:
\begin{lstlisting}
type expr = Const of int | Add of expr * expr | Mul of expr * expr 
\end{lstlisting}
For eksempel, the expression $(5 + 8) * 9$ is represented by 
\begin{lstlisting}
Mul (Add (Const 5, Const 8), Const 9)
\end{lstlisting}
