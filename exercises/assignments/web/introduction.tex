The internet is a great source of information, and many files are
published as html-files. In the following assignment(s), you are to
work with html-files on the internet.

Note that most internet pages requires a valid certificate before they will allow your program to access it. By default, Mono has no certificates installed. One way to install useful certificates is to use \lstinline[language=console]{mozroots}, which is a part of the Mono package. On Linux/MacOS you do the following from the console:
  \begin{quote}
    \lstinline[language=console]{mozroots --import --sync}
  \end{quote}
On Windows you type the following (on one line)
  \begin{quote}
    \lstinline[language=console]{mono "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mono\lib\mono\4.5\mozroots.exe" --import --sync}
  \end{quote}
Note that your installation of \lstinline[language=console]{mozroots} may be in a different path, and you may have to adapt the above path to your installation. After running the above, your program should be able to read most pages without being rejected.
