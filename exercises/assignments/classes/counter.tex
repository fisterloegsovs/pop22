Implement a class \lstinline{Counter}. The class must have two methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline{get} which returns the present value of the counter field, and
\item \lstinline{incr} which increases the counter field by 1.
\end{itemize}
The constructor must make a counter field whose value is initially 0.
Write a white-box test class that tests \lstinline{Counter}.
