Implement a class \lstinline{Counter}. The class must have 3 methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item The constructor must make a counter field whose value initially is 0,
\item \lstinline{get} which returns the present value of the counter field, and
\item \lstinline{incr} which increases the counter field by 1.
\end{itemize}
Write a white-box test class that tests \lstinline{Counter}.
