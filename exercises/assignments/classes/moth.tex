Implement a class \lstinline{Moth}, which represents a moth that is attracted to light. The moth and the light live in a 2-dimensional coordinate system with axes $(x,y)$, and the light is placed at $(0,0)$. The moth must have a field for its position in a 2-dimensional coordinate system of floats. Objects of the \lstinline{Moth} class must have the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item The constructor must accept the initial coordinates of the moth.
\item \lstinline{moveToLight} which moves the moth in a straight line from its position halfway to the position of the light.
\item \lstinline{getPosition} which returns the moth's initial position.
\end{itemize}
Make a white-box test class and test the \lstinline{Moth} class.
