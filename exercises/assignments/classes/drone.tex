In a not-so-distant future drones will be used for delivery of
groceries. Imagine that the drone-traffic has become intense in your
area and that you have been asked to decide if drones collide. Assume
that all drones fly at the same altitude, that drones fly with
different speeds measured in meters/minute and in different
directions, and that drones fly with constant speed (no
acceleration). If two drones are less than 5 meters from each other,
then they collide. When a drone reaches its destination, then it lands
and can no longer collide with any other drone. Create an implementation
file \lstinline{simulate.fs}, and add to it a \lstinline{Drone} class
with properties and methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item The constructor must take start-position, -destination, and -speed.
\item \lstinline{position} (property): returns the drone's position in $(x, y)$ coordinates.
\item \lstinline{speed} (property): returns the drone's present speed in meters/minute.
\item \lstinline{destination} (property): returns the drone's present destination in $(x, y)$ coordinates. If the drone is not flying, then its present position and its destination are the same.
\item \lstinline{fly} (method): Set the drone's new position after one
  seconds flight.
\item \lstinline{isFinished} (method): Returns true or false depending on whether the drone has reached its destination or not.
\end{itemize}

Extend your implementaiton file with a class \lstinline{Airspace}, which contains the drones and as a minimum has the following properties and methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline{drones} (property): The collection of drones instances.
\item \lstinline{droneDist} (method): The distance between two given drones.
\item \lstinline{flyDrones} (method): Advance the position of all
  flying drones in the collection by one second.
\item \lstinline{addDrone} (method): Add a new drone to the collection of drones.
\item \lstinline{willCollide} (method): Given a time interval (number
  of minutes),
  determine which drones will collide. After two (or more) drones
  collide they are assumed to fall to the ground and are no longer
  considered. The method should return a list of pairs of drones that
  collided.

  In the unfortunate event that three drones $A$, $B$ and $C$ are
  destined to collide at the same time, the list should contain the
  pairs $(A,B)$, $(A, C)$ and $(B,C)$. In this case, you are free to
  choose whether the 3 drones collide simultaneously or if one gets a
  lucky break and doges the crash. Clearly document the choice you
  make.
\end{itemize}

Write a white-box test class \lstinline{testSimulate.fsx} that tests
both of the above classes.

Note that the required methods and properties are \emph{minimum
  requirements}, feel free to add methods and properties if you need them.
