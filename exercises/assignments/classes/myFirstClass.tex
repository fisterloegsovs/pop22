\label{class:myFirstClass}
Implement a class \lstinline{student}, which has 1 property \lstinline{name} and an empty constructor. When objects of the \lstinline{student} type are created (instantiated), then the individual name of that student must be given as an argument to the default constructor. Make a program, which creates 2 \lstinline{student} objects and prints the name stored in each object using the \lexeme{.}-notation.
