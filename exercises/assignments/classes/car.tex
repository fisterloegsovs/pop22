\label{ex:car}
Implement a class \lstinline{Car} with the following properties: A car has 
\begin{enumerate}
\item a specific fuel economy measured in km/liter
\item a variable amount of fuel in liters in its tank
\end{enumerate}
The fuel economy for a particular \lstinline{Car} object must be specified as an argument to the constructor, and the initial amount of fuel in the tank should be set to 0.

\lstinline{Car} objects must have the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline{addGas}: Add a specific amount of fuel to the car.
\item \lstinline{gasLeft}: Return the present amount of fuel in the car.
\item \lstinline{drive}: Let the car drive a specific length in km, reducing the amount of fuel in the car. If there is too little fuel then cast an exception.
\end{itemize}
Make a white-box test class \lstinline{CarTest} to test \texttt{Car} and run it.
