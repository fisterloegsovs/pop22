Change the class in Exercise~\ref{class:myFirstClass} such that the value given to the default constructor is stored in a mutable field called \lstinline{name}. Make 2 methods \lstinline{getValue} and \lstinline{setValue}. \lstinline{getValue} must return the present value of an object's mutable field, and \lstinline{setValue} must take a name as an argument and set the object's mutable field to this new value. Make a program that creates 2 \lstinline{student} objects and prints the name stored in each object using \lstinline{getValue}. Use \lstinline{setValue} to change the value of one of the object's mutable fields, and print the object's new field value using \lstinline{getValue}.
