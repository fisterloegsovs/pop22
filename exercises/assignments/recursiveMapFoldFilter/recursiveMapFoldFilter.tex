\begin{enumerate}
\item Replace the library calls in \lstinline{myFold} and
  \lstinline{myFilter} with your own recursive implementations of
  these functions.
\end{enumerate}
You must also write a short report, which 
\begin{itemize}
\item is no larger than 2 pages;
\item contains a brief discussion on how your implementation works,
  and if there are any possible alternative implementations, and in
  case, why you chose the one, you did;
\item includes output that demonstrates that your program works as intented.
\end{itemize}
The report is to be handed in as a pdf document together with the
single F\# source code as an fsx file.
