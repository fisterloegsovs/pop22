A fellow programmer has made the function
\begin{quote}
  \lstinline{solutions : b:Board -> m:int -> int list}
\end{quote}
which takes an non-negative integer $m$ and seeks a possible solutions to a given board within maximally $m$ rotations. The program compiles and runs without error, but for some combinations of board-size $n$ and maximum rotations $m$, the program is very slow and the computer eventually runs out of memory. Why do you think this may be?
