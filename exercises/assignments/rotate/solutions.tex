A fellow programmer has made the function
\begin{quote}
  \lstinline{solve : b:Board -> m:int -> int list}
\end{quote}
which takes as argument a non-negative integer $m$ and returns either
the empty list or a list of rotation positions (of length $m$ or less)
that will leave the board in the solved configuration (if one such
list exists).  The program compiles and runs without error, but for
some combinations of board-size $n$ and maximum rotations $m$, the
program is very slow and the computer eventually runs out of
memory. Why do you think this may be?
