Extend your libray and your whiteboxtest with a function
\begin{quote}
  \lstinline{solutions : Board -> int -> int list list}
\end{quote}
which takes an integer $m$ and seeks possible solutions to a given board within maximally $m$ rotations. The function should return 0 or more lists of possible rotation sequences, of length no longer than $m$, and which solves the puzzle.
