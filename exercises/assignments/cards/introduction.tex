We will use the following three types to implement various functions relating to cards.

\begin{lstlisting}
type suit = Hearts | Diamonds | Clubs | Spades // The suit of a card

type rank = Two | Three | Four | Five | Six    // The rank of a card
          | Seven | Eight | Nine | Ten
          | Jack | Queen | King | Ace

type card = rank * suit          // Combination of a rank and a suit
\end{lstlisting}
