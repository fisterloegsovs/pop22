Using recursion and pattern matching, write a
function \lstinline{initDeck : unit -> card list} that returns a full
deck of cards. Check that the call \lstinline{initDeck()} returns a
list of length 52. \textbf{Hint:} Implement a recursive helper
function that takes a card $c$ as argument and uses pattern matching
on the result of calling \lstinline{succCard} on $c$. Use the
card \lstinline{(Two,Hearts)} in the initial call to your helper
function.


% let initDeck() =
%   let rec run c =
%         c :: (match succCard c with
%                   | Some c' -> run c'
%                   | None -> [])
%   in run (Two,Hearts)
%
