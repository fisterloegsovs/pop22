\label{canvas:circle}
Consider points on a circle is give by the coordinate functions
\begin{align}
  x(t) &= x_0+r\cos(t)\\
  y(t) &= y_0+r\sin(t)
\end{align}
whose center is $(x_0,y_0)$, $r$ is its radius, and where $0\leq t < 2\pi$. Use these equations to make a canvas of size $400\times 400$ with an approximation of a circle centered at $(200,200)$ and with a radius of 100. The approximation should consists of straight lines connecting $(x(t_i),y(t_i))$ with $(x(t_{i+1}),y(t_{i+1}))$ for $t = [0, 0.1, 0.2, \ldots, 2\pi)$.
