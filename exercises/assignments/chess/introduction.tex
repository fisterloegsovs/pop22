Sporring, ``Learning to program with F\#'', 2017, Chapter~21.4 describes a simplified version of Chess with only Kings and Rooks, and which we here will call Simplechess, and which is implemented in 3 files: \lstinline{chess.fs}, \lstinline{pieces.fs}, and \lstinline{chessApp.fsx}. In this assignment you are to work with this implementation.
