Modify the following program (\lstinline[language=console]{quickStartRecursiveInput.fsx}):
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec readNonZeroValue () =
  let a = int (System.Console.ReadLine ())
  match a with
    0 ->
      printfn "Error: zero value entered. Try again"
      readNonZeroValue ()
    | _ ->
      a
printfn "Please enter a non-zero value"
let b = readNonZeroValue ()
printfn "You typed: %A" b
\end{lstlisting}
such that instead of asking the user for a non-zero value, repatedly asks the user for the name of a programming language. If the user enters \lstinline{"quit"}, then the program should stop. If the user enters \lstinline{"fsharp"}, then the program should write \lstinline{"fsharp is cool"}. In all other cases, program should write \lstinline{"I don't known <name>"}, where \lstinline{"<name>"} is the string, the user entered. Example of a user dialogue is:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=console]
% dotnet fsi fsharpIsCool.fsx       
Please enter the name of a programming language:
c
I don't know "c"
Please enter the name of a programming language:
fsharp
Fsharp is cool
Please enter the name of a programming language:
quit
\end{lstlisting}
