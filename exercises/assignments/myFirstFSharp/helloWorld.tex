Start an editor and write a program which prints ``hello world'' on the screen. Save the file as a \lstinline[language=console]{.fsx} file. Execute the program from the command line using
\begin{quote}
\lstinline[language=console]{dotnet fsi <filename>}
\end{quote}
where \lstinline[language=console]{<filename>} is the name of the file you chose, and verify that it prints as expected.
