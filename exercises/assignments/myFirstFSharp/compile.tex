Repeat Exercise~\ref{ex:interactiveSession}, but this time, type the code in a text editor and save the result in a file with the suffix \texttt{.fsx}. Run through \lstinline[language=console]{fsharpi} from the console, and by first compiling it with \lstinline[language=console]{fsharpc} and executing the compiled file using \lstinline[language=console]{mono}. Consider whether the result was as expected and why.
