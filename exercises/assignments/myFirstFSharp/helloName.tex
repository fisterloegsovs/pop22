Write a program in an editor, which
\begin{enumerate}
\item Writes \lstinline[language=console]{"Hello, what is your name:"} to the screen
\item Reads the users name from the keyboard
\item Prints \lstinline[language=console]{"Hello <name>"} to the screen where \lstinline[language=console]{<name>} is replaced by what the user enters.
\end{enumerate}
Save the file, and run the program using \lstinline[language=console]{"dotnet fsi <filename>"} and verify that it does as you expect.
