Start \lstinline{dotnet fsi} and interactive mode, write a function \lstinline{subInt a b}, where the arguments are integers, and which returns $a-b$. Write a similar function \lstinline{subFloat a b} where the arguments are floats. In the type-signature returned by F\#, how can you see that these functions have 2 arguments and what their types are?
