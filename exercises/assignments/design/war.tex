War is a card game for two players. A simplified version can be
described as follows:
\begin{quote}
  War is a card game for two players using the so-called French-suited
  deck of cards. The deck is initially divided equally between the two
  players, which is organized as a stack of cards. A turn is played by
  each player showing the top of their stack. The player with the
  highest card wins the hand. Aces are the highest. The won cards are
  placed at the bottom of the winner's stack. When one player has all
  the cards, then that player wins the game.
