A calendar is a system for organizing meetings and events in time. A description of a calendar is as follows:
\begin{quote}
  The gregorian calendar consists of dates (day/month/year), with 12 months per year, and with months consisting of 28, 29, 30 or 31 days. The years are counted numerically with Jesus Christus' first year being called 1~AD, followed by 2~AD, etc., and the year prior is called 1~BC, preceded by 2~BC, etc. Thus, this calendar has no year~0, and the traditional time line is \ldots, 2~BC, 1~BC, 1~AD, 2~AD, \ldots.

  A user can enter items such as a meeting or an event into a calendar. An item consists of a start date and time, end date and time, and a text-piece. Items can also be whole-day items.

Use the nouns-and-verbs method to identify possible classes and their interactions and write 1-2 lines of description for each.
