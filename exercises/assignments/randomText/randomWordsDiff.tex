The function \lstinline{randomWords} is a random function, and you are
to test its output by the histogram of the words in the string it
produces.

Extend your library with the function,
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!diffw : t1:Tree list -> t2:Tree list -> double!}
\end{quote}
which compares two word-histograms as the average sum of squared differences,
\begin{equation}
  \text{diffw}(t_1, t_2) = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=0}^{M-1}\left(t_1(i) - t_2(i)\right)^2
\end{equation}
where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are two word histograms, and $M$ is the total
number of different words observed in the two texts.

Extend your test file with a test of \lstinline{randomWords}
as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert The Story using \lstinline{convertText} and calculate
  its word histogram.
\item Use this to generate a random text using \lstinline{randomWords} with
  $M$ words, where $M$ is the number of words in the converted The Story.
\item Calculate the distance between the word histograms of The Story
  and the random texts using \lstinline{diffw}.
\item Set the test as passed if the difference is below some threshold.
\end{enumerate}
You must choose a threshold in the above, and you must argue for your choice.
