Extend your library with the function
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!cooccurrence : src:string -> int list list!}
\end{quote}
which counts occurrences of each pairs of lower-case letter of the
English alphabet including space in a string and returns a list of
lists (a table).  In the returned list, the first element should be a
list of the counts of 'a' being the initial character, i.e., how many times ``aa'',
``ab'', ``ac'',\ldots,``az'', ``a '' was observed. The second list should containt
the counts of combinations starting with 'b', i.e., how many times
``ba'', ``bb'', ``bc'',\ldots was observed and so on. The function
should include overlapping pairs, for example, the input string
``abcd'' has the pairs ``ab'', ``bc'', and ``cd''.
