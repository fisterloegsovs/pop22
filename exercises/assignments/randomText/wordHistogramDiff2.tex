\label{diff}
The function \lstinline{wordMarkovChain} is a random function, and
you are to test its output by the cooccurrences of the words in
the string it produces.

Extend your library with the function,
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!diffw2 : c1:wordCooccurrences -> c2:wordCooccurrences -> double!}
\end{quote}
which compares two cooccurrence histograms as the average sum of squared differences,
\begin{equation}
  \text{diffw2}(c_1, c_2) = \frac{1}{M^2}\sum_{i=0}^{M-1}\sum_{j=0}^{M-1}\left(c_1(i,j) - c_2(i,j)\right)^2
\end{equation}
where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are two cooccurrence histograms of $M$ elements
such that $c_1(i,j)$ is the number of times word number $i$ is
found following word number $j$.

Extend your test file with a test of \lstinline{wordMarkovChain}
as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert The Story using \lstinline{convertText} and calculate
  its cooccurrence histogram.
\item Use this to generate a random text using \lstinline{wordMarkovChain}
  with length $M$, where $M$ is the length of the converted The Story.
\item Calculate the distance between the cooccurrence histograms of
  The Story and the random texts using \lstinline{diffw2}.
\item Set the test as passed if the difference is below some threshold.
\end{enumerate}
You must choose a threshold in the above, and you must argue for your choice.
