For a given value of a \lstinline!Tree! type, see
Exercise~\ref{wordHistogram}, write a function
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!randomWords : wHist:Tree list -> nWords:int -> string!}
\end{quote}
which generates a string with \lstinline!nWords! number of words
randomly selected to match the word distribution in
\lstinline!wHist!.

Use the function developed in Exercise~\ref{lowercase} and~\ref{wordHistogram}, and test
your function by generating a random string, whose words are
distributed as the converted characters in H.C.\ Andersen's fairy
tale, ``Little Claus and Big Claus''. Calculate the word histogram for
the random text, and compare this with \lstinline{wHist}.
