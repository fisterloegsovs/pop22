Write a program that generates a random string of length
\lstinline!len!, whose character triples are distributed according to a
user specified trioccurrence histogram \lstinline!trioc!.  The function
must have the type:
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!sndOrderMarkovModel : trioc:int list list list -> len:int -> string!}
\end{quote}
Use the function developed in Exercise~\ref{triocurrence}, and test
your function by generating a random string, whose character triples are
distributed as the converted characters in H.C.\ Andersen's fairy
tale, ``Little Claus and Big Claus''. Calculate the trioccurrence
histogram for the random string, and compare this with the original
trioccurrence histogram.
