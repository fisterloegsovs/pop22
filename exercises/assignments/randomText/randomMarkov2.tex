Write a function
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!fstOrderMarkovModel : cooc:int list list -> len:int -> string!}
\end{quote}
which generates a random string of length \lstinline!len!, whose
character pairs are distributed according to a user specified
cooccurrence histogram \lstinline!cooc!.

Use the function developed in Exercise~\ref{lowercase} and~\ref{coocurrence}, and test
your function by generating a random string, whose character pairs are
distributed as the converted characters in H.C.\ Andersen's fairy
tale, ``Little Claus and Big Claus''. Calculate the cooccurrence
histogram for the random string, and compare this with the original
cooccurrence histogram.
