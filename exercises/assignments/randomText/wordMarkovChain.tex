Extend your library with a function
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!wordMarkovChain : wCooc: wordCooccurrences -> nWords:int -> string!}
\end{quote}
which generates a random string with\lstinline! nWords! words, whose
word-pairs are distributed according to the cooccurrence
histogram \lstinline!wCooc!.
