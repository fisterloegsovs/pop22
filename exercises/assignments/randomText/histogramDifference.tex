\label{diff}
The function \lstinline{randomString} is not easily tested using
white- or blackbox testing since it is a random function. Instead
you are to test its output by the histogram of the characters in the
string it produces.

Extend your library with the function,
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!diff : h1:int list -> h2:int list -> double!}
\end{quote}
which compares two histograms as the average sum of squared differences,
\begin{equation}
  \text{diff}(h_1,h_2) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\left(h_1(i) - h_2(i)\right)^2
\end{equation}
where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are two histograms of $N$ elements.

Extend your test file with a test of \lstinline{randomString} as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert The Story using \lstinline{convertText} and calculate
  its histogram.
\item Use this to generate a random text using
  \lstinline{randomString} with length $N$, where $N$ is the length of
  the converted The Story.
\item Calculate the distance between the histograms of The Story and
  the random texts using \lstinline{diff}.
\item Set the test as passed if the difference is below some threshold.
\end{enumerate}
You must choose a threshold in the above, and you must argue for your choice.
