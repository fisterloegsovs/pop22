In terms of a Markov Chain, what order is \lstinline{randomWords}?
Suggest an extension of \lstinline{type Tree} to include first order
Markov Chains. Speculate on whether this principle can be used to
extend to n'th order mordels, and, in case, speculate on how the
storage requirements will grow as n grows.
