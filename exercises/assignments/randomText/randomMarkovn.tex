The function \lstinline{randomString} may be considered a zero-order
Markov Chain model, since each generated character is independent on
any previously generated characters. The function
\lstinline{fstOrderMarkovModel} generates new characters dependent on
the previous character and is therefore a first-order Markov Chain
model. Consider a similar extension to an n'th-order Markov Chain
where the occurrences of n-tupples of characters are stored in
\lstinline{n : int list list ... list}. What possible pit-falls are
there with this representation?
