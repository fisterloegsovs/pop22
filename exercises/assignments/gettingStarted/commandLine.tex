Start the command line (or terminal on MacOS). Use the \texttt{cd}-command to navigate to a suitable directory for your work. (e.g.\ the Documents folder). Use the
\begin{quote}
\lstinline[language=console]{mkdir <name>}
\end{quote}
command to create a new directory from the command line. Replace \lstinline[language=console]{<name>} with the name of your new directory.
% Use a text-editor to create a \LaTeX\ document using the class \texttt{article}. The preamble must define the title ``Hello world'', your name as the author, and today's date as the date. The main part of the document must use \verb!\maketitle! to produce the title and the text ``Hello again''. Convert the \LaTeX\ to \texttt{pdf} from the command line.
