Design a game in Scratch:\\
You are to design a game of your own choosing. The game must
\begin{itemize}
\item include 2--5 sprites 
\item have a typical gameplay of about 1 minute
\item must include at least 1 variable
\end{itemize}
You may use any existing block in Scratch, and the game may be similar
to an existing game. The graphical appeal and the sound aspects of the
games are of little importance.

A good approach is to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start by brainstorming about a game, you would like to make
  and what the game mechanics should be.
\item Sketch a design on paper about the gameplay.
\item Implement your design as a sketch of a Scratch program, still on paper.
\item Enter your prototype into Scratch and test it.
\item Return to the top and update your game until you are satisfied with the result.
\end{enumerate}
