Consider the library from Assignment~\ref{implementation}. Assuming
that your module is called \lstinline{Color}, consider the following application
\begin{codeNOutput}{: Application of a Color library.}
  \begin{lstlisting}
let red = (255,0,0)
let green = (0,255,0)  
let avg = Color.add red green
let factor = 1.25
let bright = Color.scale factor avg
printfn "Bright gray is: %A" bright
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{codeNOutput}
If your functions \lstinline{add} and \lstinline{scale} have a
different interface, then adjust accordingly. Perform a tracing by
hand of the above code including the implementation of your
library. Run the (adjusted) code with \filename{fsharpc}. Did you
discover any errors? Do you get the same output?
