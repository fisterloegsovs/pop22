Extend the library (both the signature and the implementation file) from Assignment~\ref{signature} and~\ref{implementation}) with a function that converts a color tripple into a tripple of identical gray values. Extend your test with a suitable set of tests of this new function. Discuss whether the library, application, and test are structured in a way such that the extension has been easy, or whether there are dependencies that makes correcting, maintaining, extending the code difficult and with a high risk of introducing new errors.
