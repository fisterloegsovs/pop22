\subsection*{Tree traversal by structural recursion}

The length of a catenable list can be defined by structural recursion on \verb|'a catlist|:
\begin{lstlisting}{fsharp}
let rec length' xs =
    match xs with
      Empty -> 0
    | Single _ -> 1
    | Append (ys, zs) -> length' ys + length' zs
\end{lstlisting}

Define in an analogous fashion the function \verb|sum': int catlist -> int|, which computes the sum of the integer values in its
input. Test that is computes the correct results on carefully chosen inputs, including the ``extremal'' value \verb|nil|.
