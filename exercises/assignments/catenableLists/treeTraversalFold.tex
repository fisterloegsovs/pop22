\subsection*{Tree traversal by folding}

Structural recursion on \verb|'a catlist| can be captured by a parameterized higher-order function
\begin{lstlisting}{fsharp}
fold: (('a -> 'a -> 'a) * 'a) -> ('b -> 'a) -> 'b catlist -> 'a
\end{lstlisting}
such that the length function can be defined by
\begin{lstlisting}{fsharp}
let length xs = fold ((+), 0) (fun _ -> 1) xs
\end{lstlisting}
without using ``rec'' in its definition.

Define \verb|fold| by structural recursion analogous to \verb|treeFold| for binary trees (see lecture slides).
