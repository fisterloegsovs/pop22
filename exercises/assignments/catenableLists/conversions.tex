\subsection*{Conversion to and from cons-lists}

Write functions
\begin{lstlisting}{fsharp}
val fromCatList : 'a catlist -> 'a list
val toCatList : 'a list -> 'a catlist
\end{lstlisting}
for converting between built-in cons-lists and catenable lists in linear time, first using structural recursion on catenable lists and built-in lists, respectively.
\footnote{Tip: Use difference lists as an intermediate data structure when converting from catenable lists.}

Then express your definitions without explicit recursion, using the higher-order functions \\ \texttt{List.foldBack} and \texttt{CatList.fold} instead.

(Optional: Your function \verb|toCatList| will probably construct skewed binary trees.  The function \verb|balTree| presented in the lecture constructs a balanced search tree that.  By analogy construct a balanced catenable list in time $\Theta(n \log n)$.  

(Optional challenge: Come up with an implementation for \verb|toCatList| that yields a balanced catenable list in linear time, that is in time $O(n)$.)
