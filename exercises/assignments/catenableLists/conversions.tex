\subsection*{Conversion to and from cons-lists}

Write functions
\begin{verbatim}
val fromCatList : 'a catlist -> 'a list
val toCatList : 'a list -> 'a catlist
\end{verbatim}
for converting between built-in cons-lists and catenable lists in linear time, using structural recursion on catenable lists and built-in lists, respectively.\footnote{Tip: Use difference lists as an intermediate data structure when converting from catenable lists.}

(Optional: Express your definitions without explicit recursion, using the \texttt{List.foldBack} and \texttt{CatList.fold} higher-order functions instead.)

(Optional challenge problem: The function \verb|toCatList| will construct skewed binary trees.  The function \verb|balTree| presented in the lecture constructs a balanced search tree that, by analogy, yields a way of constructing a balanced catenable list, but in time $\Theta(n \log n)$.  Come up with an implementation for \verb|toCatList| that yields a balanced catenable list in time $O(n)$.)
