\section*{Difference lists and equational rewriting}

A strong point of \emph{purely} functional programming, that is programming with functions that have no side-effects, is that they satisfy algebraic equalities that can be applied to rewrite expressions and yet be guaranteed to be observationally equivalent even when the expression contains variables whose binding is unknown.\footnote{This is a hallmark of mathematical notation and functional programming. 
%No ``real'' programming language with (implicit) side effects, however, has this property; thus secure and correct \emph{automatic} program analysis, program synthesis and optimization is vastly more difficult with such programming languages.  Indeed, while the level of abstraction has been lifted substantially over the last fifty or so years, bringing more automation and security than previously to bear, programming is still largely a manual process of humans hand-typing code into an editor --- which is a somewhat paradoxical aspect:  Even with modern of even modern software development methods (which are technology supported, but still largely manual) the very discipline that automates engineering and processing in \emph{other} disciplines is itself still largely manual craftsmanship.
