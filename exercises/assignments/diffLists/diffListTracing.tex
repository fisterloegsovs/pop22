Rewriting can help correctly derive more efficient code or just code that may be more easily understandable in terms of more elementary operations.

Consider the compact linear-time implementation for computing the preorder of a binary tree
\begin{lstlisting}{fsharp}
type 'a tree = 
     Empty | Leaf of 'a | Branch of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree
open DiffList // nil, single, append, fromDiffList
let combinePre (dl1, x, dl2) = append (single x) (append dl1 dl2)
let preorder' t = treeFold (nil, single, combinePre) t
let preorder t = fromDiffList (preorder' t)
\end{lstlisting}
where \verb|treeFold| from the lecture slides of lecture week 8 is defined as
\begin{lstlisting}{fsharp}
let treeFold (e, lf, bf) =
    let rec f t = 
        match t with
          Empty -> e
        | Leaf x -> lf x
        | Branch (t1, x, t2) -> bf (f t1, x, f t2)
    f
\end{lstlisting}
See DiffList.fs for the definitions of difference list operations \verb|nil|, \verb|single|, \verb|append| and \verb|fromDiffList|.

Rewrite \verb|preorder'| starting with the expression
\begin{lstlisting}{fsharp}
preorder' t xs
\end{lstlisting}
by \emph{unfolding} and \emph{folding} definitions of functions to arrive at definition of \verb|preorder'| of the form
\begin{lstlisting}{fsharp}
let preorder t xs =
    match t with 
      ... -> ... 
    | ... -> ...
    | ... -> ... preorder' ... preorder'
\end{lstlisting}
In particular, unfold all definitions of functions on difference lists.

Unfolding is the process of replacing a term of the form \verb|f ...| with the corresponding right-hand side of the definition of function \verb|f|.
Folding is the converse.

Finally, do the same for \verb|preorder| by rewriting
\begin{lstlisting}{fsharp}
preorder t xs
\end{lstlisting}
