Write a \texttt{Person} class with data properties for a person's name, address, and telephone number. Next, write a class named \texttt{Customer} that is a subclass of the \texttt{Person} class. The \texttt{Customer} class should have a positive integer data property for a unique customer number and a boolean data property indicating whether the customer wishes to be on a mailing list. Write a small program, which makes an instance of the \texttt{Customer} class.
