First write a function,
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!tac : filenames:string list -> string!}
\end{quote}
which takes a list of files, concatenates them and prints the result
line by line in reverse order (i.e. the opposite of \lstinline{cat} on a
line-by-line basis), and returns the result as a string.

Then write a program, \lstinline[language=console]{tac}, which takes a
list of filenames as command line arguments, calls the \lstinline{tac}
function with this list and prints the resulting string to the screen
using \lstinline{printFile} (exercise~\ref{cat:printFile}).
