\subsection*{Reading contents of file}

Implement a function \texttt{readFile: filename:string -> byte[]} with the following specification. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Precondition: None (any string is acceptable and must be handled)
\item Postcondition: If the input string is a readable file, return its contents.  Otherwise raise exception \texttt{FileNotFoundException} if the file does not exist or is not readable.
\end{itemize}

The function should obtain a \texttt{FileStream}, e.g. through \texttt{File.OpenRead}, and use your \texttt{readBytes} to read the filestream.

Note: While it is possible to implement this function using \texttt{File.ReadAllBytes}, the intended learning goal of this exercise is how to \textit{implement your own version}.
