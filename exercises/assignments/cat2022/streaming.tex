Provide another implementation of \texttt{cat: string[] -> int} that uses only a constant amount of memory, 64 bytes as a buffer for data read.  Note that you must satisfy the same specification for \texttt{cat}; in particular, nothing is to be written to stdout. Errors should be written to stderr.

Use the code in the \verb!StreamingCat! directory in \verb!7i_handout.zip! as a starting point. 

You \textit{must} implement the functions \texttt{cat} and \texttt{catWithBufferSize}.
