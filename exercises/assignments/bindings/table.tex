\label{multiplicationTable} Make a program, which writes the
multiplication table for the number 10 to the screen formatted as
follows:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
    &1 & 2 & \dots & 10\\
    1 &1 & 2 & \dots & 10\\
    2 &2 & 4 & \dots & 20\\
    \vdots \\
    10 &10 & 20 & \dots & 100\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
I.e., left row and top columns are headers showing which numbers have
been multiplied for an element in the temple. You must use
\lstinline!for!  loops for the repeated operations, and the field
width of all the positions in the table must be identical.
