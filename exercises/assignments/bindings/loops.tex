\label{table} Use the function developed in Assignment~\ref{linearFct}, such that the values for the arguments $a=3$, $b=4$, and $x=0\ldots5$ are written using 6 \lstinline!printfn! statements. Modify this program to use a \lstinline!for! loop and a single \lstinline!printfn! statement. Repeat the modification, but this time by using a \lstinline!while! loop instead. Which modification is simplest and which is most elegant?
