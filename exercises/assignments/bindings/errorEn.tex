The following program:
  \begin{codeNOutput}{: Strings.}
\begin{lstlisting}
let firstName = "Jon"
let lastName = "Sporring" in let name = firstName + " " + lastName;;
printfn "Hello %A!" name;;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{codeNOutput}
was supposed to write ``Hello Jon Sporring!'' to the
screen. Unfortunately, it contains an error and will not compile. Find
and correct the error(s). Rewrite the program into a single line without
the use of semicolons.
