The following program,
\begin{codeNOutput}{: Strenge.}
  \begin{lstlisting}
let firstName = "Jon"
let lastName = "Sporring" in let name = firstName + " " + lastName;;
printfn "Hello %A!" name;;
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{codeNOutput}
is supposed to write ``Hello Jon Sporring!'' to the screen, but
unfortunately, it contains at least one mistake. Correct the
mistake(s). Rewrite the program into a one-line program without the
use of semicolons. Consider how many ways this can be done, where you
still use the bindings \lstinline!firstName!, \lstinline!lastName!,
\lstinline!name!, and the \lstinline!printfn! function.
