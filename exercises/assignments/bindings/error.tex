The following program,
\begin{lstlisting}
let firstName = "Jon"
let lastName = "Sporring
printfn "Hello %A!" firstName+lastName
\end{lstlisting}
is supposed to write ``Hello Jon Sporring!'' to the screen, but
unfortunately, it contains at least one mistake. Correct the
mistake(s) and rerun the program.
