Consider the signature file given in \Cref{vec2dsmall} which contains
some of the standard operations for vectors.
%
\fsSignature{vec2dsmall}{vec2dsmall}{A signature file for vector operations.}{}
%
Solve the following sub-tasks:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Extend the signature file with documentation using the documentation
standard.
\item Write a library \filename{vec2dsmall.fs} implementing the
  signatures.
\item Compile the signature and the implementation into
  \filename{vec2dsmall.dll} demonstrating that there are no syntax
  errors.
\end{enumerate}
