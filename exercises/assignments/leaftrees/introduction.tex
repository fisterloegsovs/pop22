In the following exercises, we shall investigate the following recursive type definition for binary trees:
\begin{lstlisting}
type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | Tree of 'a tree * 'a tree
\end{lstlisting}
A term of the form \lstinline{Leaf $x$} is called a \emph{leaf} (or \emph{leaf node});
a term of the form \lstinline{Tree $(t1, t2)$} is called a \emph{tree node}.
The tree type is generic in the type of data that in the leaf nodes.
