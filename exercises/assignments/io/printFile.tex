Make a program with the function,
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!printFile : unit -> unit!}
\end{quote}
which initiates a dialogue with the user using
\lstinline{filenameDilaogue} from
Exercise~\ref{io:filenameDialogue}. The function must ask the user for
the name of a file, and if it exists, then the content is to be
printed to the screen. The program must return 0 or 1 depending on
whether the specified file exists or not.
