Make a program \lstinline{myFirstReadKey} which continuously reads
from the keyboard using the \lstinline{System.Console.ReadKey()}
function. The following key-presses must result in the following:
\begin{quote}
  \begin{description}
  \item['a'] writes "left" to the screen
  \item['s'] writes "right" to the screen
  \item['w'] writes "up" to the screen
  \item['z'] writes "down" to the screen
  \item[shift+'q'] quits the program
  \end{description}
\end{quote}
All other key-presses must be ignored. When the program exits,
the exit status must be 0.
