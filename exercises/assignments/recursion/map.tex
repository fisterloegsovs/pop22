Write a function
%
\lstinline{map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list}
%
that takes a function and a list as arguments and returns a new list of
the same length as the argument list with elements obtained by
applying the supplied function on each of the elements of the argument
list. The function should make use of recursion and pattern matching
on lists.

As an example, a call
%
\lstinline{map (fun x -> x+2) [2;3]}
%
should return the list \lstinline{[4;5]}.
