Write a new factorial function as in Assignment~\ref{fac} but with the name and type \lstinline{facOption : n:int -> int option}, which returns \lstinline{Some m}, when the result is computable and \lstinline{None} otherwise. Call \lstinline{fac} with the values $n=-4,0,1,4$, and write the result to the screen.
