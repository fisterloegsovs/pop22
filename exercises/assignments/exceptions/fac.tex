\label{fac} Add a new and selfdefined exception \lstinline{ArgumentTooBig of string} to \lstinline{fac} in Assignment~\ref{fac1}, and cast it with the argument \lstinline{"calculation would result in an overflow"}, when $n$ is too large for the \lstinline{int} type. Call the function with a small and a large value of $n$, catch the possible exception and handle it in case by writing the exception message to the screen.
