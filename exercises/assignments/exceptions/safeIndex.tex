Make implementations of the following functions:
\begin{quote}
  \mbox{\lstinline!safeIndexIf : arr:'a [] -> i:int -> 'a!}
  \\\mbox{\lstinline!safeIndexTry : arr:'a [] -> i:int -> 'a!}
  \\\mbox{\lstinline!safeIndexOption : arr:'a [] -> i:int -> 'a option!}
\end{quote}
Each of them must return the value of \lstinline!arr! at index \lstinline!i!, when \lstinline!i! is a valid index, and otherwise handle the error-situation.  The error-situations must be handled in different ways:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lstinline!safeIndexIf! must not make use of \lstinline!try!-\lstinline!with! and must not cast an exception.
  \item \lstinline!safeIndexTry! must use \lstinline!try!-\lstinline!with!, and it must call \lstinline!failwith! when there is an error. 
  \item \lstinline!safeIndexOption! must return \lstinline!None! in case of an error. 
  \end{itemize}
  Make a short test of all 3 functions, by writing the content of an array to the screen (and not as an option type). The tests must also include examples of error situations and must be able to handle possible exceptions casted. In your opinion, is any of the above method superior or inferior in how they handle errors and why?
