In the following, you are to implement your own queue module using lists in F\# to represent the (sequence of elements in) a queue.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given the description of the abstract datatype Queue above, write a signature file for the functional queues.  The module is to be called \lstinline{queue}.
\item Write an implementation file, implementing the signature file above using lists in F\# where the elements are F\# integers.
\item Write an application file, which as minimum consists of the following series of tests of your queue module:
\begin{lstlisting}
let q0 = emptyQueue
printfn "%A, %A, %A" q0 (isEmpty q0) (dequeue q0)
let q1 = create () |> enqueue 1 |> enqueue 2 |> enqueue 3
printfn "%A, %A" q1 (isEmpty q1)
let (e,q2) = dequeue q1
printfn "%A, %A" e q2
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
