A problem with the queue specification above is that there is a precondition on the dequeue operation: A programmer must always ensure that the argument to dequeue is nonempty before calling dequeue. In other words, even though the F\# type system does not flag it as an error, it \emph{is} an error (by the programmer) to call dequeue with the empty queue.

Change the queue specification such that \lstinline{dequeue} returns an \lstinline{(element option) * queue} value and remove the precondition.  Write an application demonstrating that your implementation works; that is, its operations perform queuing and dequeuing, and, additionally \lstinline{dequeue(emptyQueue)} returns \lstinline{None}.
