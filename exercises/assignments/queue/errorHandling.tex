A problem with the integer queue module is, that it does not handle errors, if \lstinline{dequeue} is applied to an empty queue. Extend your library and the application such that \lstinline{dequeue} returns an \lstinline{(element option)*queue}. Write an application demonstrating that your implementation works.
