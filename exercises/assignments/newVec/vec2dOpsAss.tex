Building upon the exercises concerning vectors and their representation as tuples, we will construct a small library of functions for 2-dimensional vector operations, with vectors represented as tuples of floats.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a function:
  \begin{quote}
    \mbox{\lstinline!scaleFloatVec : float * float -> scalar:float -> float * float!}
  \end{quote}
  that given a vector of floats and a scalar, scales the vector and returns the resulting vector.

\item Write a function:
  \begin{quote}
    \mbox{\lstinline!addFloatVecs : float * float -> float * float -> float * float!}
  \end{quote}
  that given two vectors of floats, adds them and returns the resulting vector.

\item Write a function:
  \begin{quote}
    \mbox{\lstinline!subFloatVecs : float * float -> float * float -> float * float!}
  \end{quote}
  that given two vectors of floats, subtracts them with vector subtraction and returns the resulting vector.

\item Write a function:
  \begin{quote}
    \mbox{\lstinline!lengthFloatVec : float * float -> float!}
  \end{quote}
  that given a vectors of floats, computes the length of the vector and returns the result as a float.

\item Write a function:
  \begin{quote}
    \mbox{\lstinline!dotFloatVecs : float * float -> float * float -> float!}
  \end{quote}
  that given two vectors of floats, computes the dot product and returns the result as a float.
  
\end{enumerate}
