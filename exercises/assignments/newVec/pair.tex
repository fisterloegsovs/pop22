In the following, you are to work with tuples.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Make a type abbreviation called \lstinline{vec3}, which is a 3-tuple of \lstinline{float}s.
  \item Make a value of \lstinline{vec3}.
  \item Make a function, which takes a \lstinline{vec3} as argument and returns the squared sum of its elements, and test it on the value, you created. Consider the different ways, the function's type could be written, and what their qualitative differences would be.
\end{enumerate}
