Write a function \lstinline{split: xs:int list -> (xs1: int list) * (xs2: int list)} which separates the list \lstinline{xs} into two and returns the result as a tuple where all the elements with even index is in the first element and the rest in the second. For example, \mbox{\lstinline{split [x0; x1; x2; x3; x4]}} should return \mbox{\lstinline{([x0; x2; x4], [x1; x3])}}.
