%\label{arr2D}Arrays are an alternative data structure for tables.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
Use \lstinline{Array2D.init}, \lstinline{Array2D.length1} and \lstinline{Array2D.length2} to make the function \lstinline{transposeArr : 'a [,] -> 'a [,]} which transposes the elements in input.
%\item Make a whitebox test of \lstinline{transposeArr}.
%\item Comparing this implementation with Assignment~\ref{listTranspose}, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these implementations?
%\item For the application of tables, which of lists and arrays are better programmed using the imperative paradigm and using the functional paradigm and why?
%\end{enumerate}
