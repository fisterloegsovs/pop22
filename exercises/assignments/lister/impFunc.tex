Use \lstinline{Array2D.init}, \lstinline{Array2D.length1} and \lstinline{Array2D.length2} to make the function \lstinline{transpose : 'a [,] -> 'a [,]} which transposes the elements in input. Comparing this implementation with Assignment~\ref{listTranspose}, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these implementations?
