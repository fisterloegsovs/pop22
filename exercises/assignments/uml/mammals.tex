Write a UML diagram for the following:

A class called \texttt{Animal} and has the following attributes (choose names yourself): 
\begin{itemize}
\item The amount of food needed daily (measured in kilograms)
\item The weight of the animal (measured in kilograms)
\item The maximum speed of the animal (measured in kilometres per hour)
\item The current speed of the animal (measured in kilometres per hour)
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{Animal} class should have two methods (choose appropriate names):
\begin{itemize}
\item The first method should set the current speed of the animal proportionately to its food intake and maximum speed as follows: if the animal eats 100\% of the amount of food it needs daily, the animal's current speed should be its maximum speed; if the animal eats 50\% of the amount of food it needs daily, the animal's current speed should be 50\% of its maximum speed, and so on.
\item The second method should set the amount of food needed daily proportionately to the animal's weight as follows: the animal should eat half its own weight in food every day (if the animal weighs 50 kg, it should eat 25kg of food daily).
\end{itemize}

A subclass \texttt{Carnivore} that inherits everything from class \texttt{Animal}.

A subclass \texttt{Herbivore} that inherits everything from class \texttt{Animal}, and modifies the second method as follows: the animal should eat 40\% of its own weight in food every day.

A class called \texttt{Game} consisting of one or more instances of \texttt{Carnivore} and \texttt{Herbivore}.
